# Search Products from Amazon

This project allows you to search for products on Amazon using a web application. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and utilizes the Amazon Product Advertising API for fetching product data.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```shell
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

## Local Development
To run the project locally, use the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and make the application accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Make sure to provide your Amazon Product Advertising API credentials in the appropriate configuration file (e.g., config.js). Without valid credentials, the application may not function correctly.

Feel free to explore and customize the project as per your requirements. Happy coding!
